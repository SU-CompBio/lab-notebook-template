# Project title

Recommended structure for bioinformatics projects, and lab noteboks. Work in
progress, comments are welcome.

### Name and University/Institute/Department

Started on: 2021-01-01

Short summary of the project, with links to additional repositories, software
and databases relevant for the project. The summary should include the
following:

- Main question you are trying to answer. If pigs could fly, would they have
  bat, insect or bird-like wings? What would be their maximum speed?
- The tools and methods you are using to investigate this. CRISPR-editing of pig
  genes, linear modeling in R to find out the relationship between weight and
  maximum speed, field investigations in rural areas. Of course, this will
  change, but a starting set of tools and methods should be mentioned.
- Some background information. What is known in the field, is it a well-studied
  area, or flying pigs are a completely new groundbreaking research topic? Link
  a few reviews, or the paper(s) leading to the main question.
